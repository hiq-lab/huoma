//! `huoma` — Projector simulator with commensurability-guided MPS.
//!
//! Decomposes a quantum circuit into stable (analytically solvable) and
//! volatile (must-simulate) partitions using the sin(C/2) commensurability
//! filter from the Tilde Pattern (Hinderink 2026). Only the volatile
//! partition is simulated via MPS with adaptive per-bond truncation.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! ```text
//! Circuit → frequency extraction → channel assessment → partitioning
//!     → stable (analytical) + volatile (MPS/QPU) → reassembly
//! ```
